Introducing a nifty app that puts my record collection in the spotlight, pulling data straight from the Discogs API. Each album on display is a clickable gem, unlocking a trove of additional information like genre tags, recording year, and convenient links to Apple Music â€“ perfect for seamless streaming if the album is up for grabs.
